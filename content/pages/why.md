Yes Operator is here to guide people through the forest of computer programming. The beginning is confusing for everyone, but you don't have to go through it alone. With Yes Operator you will get to your next destination not by a precise map, but a web of [desire paths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_path), well-trodden by others on the same journey.

To do this, Yes Operator will create a space where people learning to program can hear voices of people walking the same path. Those voices will:

- ask similar questions,
- surprise everyone with novel questions,
- inspire with their own breakthroughs in understanding,
- flounder at the same confusing, opaque jargon,
- and show that anyone can learn to program.

Yes Operator will favor dialogue and experiential learning over lectures or the mentality of "you must go through the pain I went through to understand."

Yes Operator is not the voice of an expert. Experience is only valuable to share if it comes with humility and context. That is, the challenges one faced in the past are not equivalent to those which others face today.

Yes Operator will seek to understand the language, level, and interests of learners and meet them there, rather than prescribe some ideal, sequential learning path.

Yes Operator will be a humble effort. Yes Operator itself learns and grows. Any of the above is subject to change, forgetfulness, mistakes, refinement.
